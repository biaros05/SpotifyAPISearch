# SpotifyAPISearch
For this lab, we created an interface which searches through the spotify API and allows us to browse songs and save them as our favourites
## Usage
Log into the Spotify dashboard using your Spotify account.
Create an app and select "Web API" for the question asking which APIs are you planning to use. Once you have created your app, you will have access to the app credentials. These will be required for API authorization to obtain an access token.
Once this is done, please head to the lab26.jsx file and replace the following variables with the correct values according to your credentials:
```
  const CLIENT_ID = "CLIENT ID HERE";
  const REDIRECT_URI = "REDIRECT URL HERE";
```
